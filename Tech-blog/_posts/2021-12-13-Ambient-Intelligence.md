## Ambient intelligence refers to:

Electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the pesence of people.
Ambient intelligence is the vision of a technology that will become invisible embedded in our natural sorrounding, present whenever we need it enabled by simple and effortless interactions.

In terms of smarthomes, ambient intelligence devices quietly pay attention to the actions of end users in certain environment s -learning what people do, how they respond and their intrests - to ake intuitive and data-based guesses regarding what users want which action to perform.

This can be as simple as turning on light or maing sure your home is preheated in the evening because it knows you arrive home late on friday nights . Ambient inteligence represents one of the more advanced, almost esoteric , elements in smart home development.

It generally offers a new level of human-computer interaction in which people are sorrounded by intelligent and intuitive interfaces embedded in the everyday objects around them.

### Ageneric layout of a smart home includes the following:

Smart Home Hubs :Consider this the brain of your house. The home hub has the sole responsibility of connecting all your smart devices. All your smart electronics connect to the hub and give you control via Bluetooth technology. We are already familiar with devices like the Echo and the Echo Dot, but Amazon is not the only company with a hub on the market. With the right research, you’re sure to find the perfect fit for your own home.


Lighting Control:There are smart wall plugs on the market that can make any lamp or non-connected appliances Wi-Fi capable. The plugs make normal analog home furnishings into digital smart devices just by plugging into them. Some offer voice control, power usage reports, and flexible scheduling.


Wireless Entertainment: Entertainment gadgets and electronics are usually the first things to get an upgrade. TVs, speakers, tablets, and streaming sources are all connectable. Video gaming systems can serve as a home hub, too. It’s possible to connect it all and watch all your programming anywhere in the world.


Smart Security: Home security products like doorbell cameras, security cameras, and motion detectors are all available with built-in connectivity. They allow you to monitor your home no matter where you are. The Ring doorbell is gaining in popularity because it lets people see who is at their door without having to open it. Police are finding it useful in solving crimes as well. The videos catch porch pirates and record car crashes that are used later to catch criminals.




### Components of a smart home:

Sensors: Tiny, inexpensive beacons that incorporate Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transmit signals as part of a smart home platform

Standardization: The ease with which proprietary home devices work together

Ambient Intelligence (AmI): AmI weaves together data from many sources to "learn" user's habits, understand the context and purpose of a request, then perform an action

Wireless Communications: Mobile, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and energy-saving communication protocols enable anytime/anywhere connectivity

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): The capacity of intelligent, intuitive interfaces embedded in everyday objects to respond to end.




### Challenges of Ami in homes.

A key smart home challenge is the accurate tracking and instant, automatic response to individuals as they move through an environment. Several factors are converging to make smart home interactivity a reality.

For example, the widespread deployment of wireless capabilities—mobile, WiFi, Bluetooth—enable communication from just about anywhere. But tracking is a simple concept that is much harder to execute.

That's because instant smart home interactions require the processing of locational data and the use of efficient algorithms. (It's striking how a few seconds delay can matter when simply turning on a light.)

This is partly related to the difficulty of Bluetooth beacons, or sensors, to effectively relay location, and the speed with which current algorithms can process and respond to the information.

A potential drawback of existing Smart Homes technology is the need for the user to wear sensor devices, e.g. for position sensing and fall detection. This is contrary to the notion of AmI, which places the emphasis on the enriched environment to act intelligently and provides significant technological challenges for researchers.



### What's Next For the Smart Home?
The current smart home market is not only diffuse with competing visions, it's also hampered by interoperability issues and an overall lack of standardization.

Industry watchers and analysts believe the key to the success of the market hinges less on a particular device and more on the connectivity platform all of the major players agree to buy into. The value is in increased simplicity, not more complexity.

For example, the notion of employing six different apps to automate a single home is deeply unappealing to consumers. As AmI systems for the smart home become more affordable and accessible, and are better able to respond to home owners' needs, look for the next critical issue—privacy.

In this regard, effective security will be crucial, both to protect information and to guard against the potential abuse of those systems.
