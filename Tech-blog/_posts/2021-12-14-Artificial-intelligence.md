#### Outline
- Understand basic concepts of AI.
- Understand AI technologies and their deelopment history.
- Understand the application technologies and application fields of AI.
- Know the development history of AI.


Humans naturally learn from experience – that is, by trial and error.  And humans can apply what they learn to different contexts.  Neither trait comes naturally to AI systems 

They can only learn and apply what they’ve been programmed to learn and the programming is difficult. Humans can learn in multiple areas and automatically apply what they learn.

Humans are often involved in complex situations.  In business, executives face complicated legislation, rapidly changing markets and competition, and many more complexities, yet must make decisions, sometimes quickly, that affect their company’s future.  People can make mistakes and learn from them.  However, computers can handle only those complex situations that they’re programmed to handle.

Humans continually make decisions under uncertainty – that is, with partial or even inaccurate, information. AI systems can handle such situations in many contexts.

Everyday humans receive masses of incoming information.  People can screen the information and discard irrelevant information a skill built through experience  on the other hand computers are limited by their programming and it’s not easy to program a computer to know what’s irrelevant.


***What are intelligences?***
Howard Gardner's Multiple intelligences

Human intelligences can be devided into seven categories:
- Verbal/Linguistic
- Logical/Mathematical
- Bodily/Kinesthetic
- Musical/Rhythimic
- Inter-personal/social
- Intra-personal/introspective



***What is AI?***
Artificial intelligence(AI) is a new technical science that studies and develops theories, methods, techniques & application systems for simulating and extending human intelligence.  

In 1956, the concept of AI was first proposed by John MacCarthy, who defined the subject as "Science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer progrms." AI is concerned with making machines work in an intelligent way, similar to the way that the human mind works. At present, AI has become an interdisciplinary course that involves various fields.






#### Relationship of AI, Machine learning, and deep learning

Relationship between AI, Machine learning, and Deep learning

- AI: A new technical science that focuses on the research and development of theories, methods, techniques, and applications systems for simulating and extending human intelligence.

- Machine learning: A core research field of AI. It focuses on how computers can obtain new knowledge or skills by simulating or performing the learning behavior of human beings and recognizing existing knowledge architecture to improve its performance. It is one of the core research fields of AI.

- Deep learning: A new field of machine learning. The concept of deep learning originates from the research on artificial neural networks. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of deep learning architecture. Deep learning aims to simulate the human brain to interpret data such as images, sounds, and texts.

Three major schools of thought: Symbolism.

a) Basic Thoughts
- The cognitive process of human beings is the process of inference and operation of various symbols.

- A human is a physical symbol system, and so is a computer. Computers, therefore, can be used to simulate the intelligent behavior of human beings.

- The core of AI relies in knowledge representation, knowledge inference, and knowledge application. Knowledge and concepts can be represented with symbols. Cognition is the process of symbol processing while inference refers to the process of solving problems by using heuristic knowledge and search.

- Representative of symbolism: inference, including symbolic inference and machine interface.



#### Representative of symbolism: inference, including symbolic inference and machine inference.

- The basis of thinking is neurons rather than the process of symbol processing.

- Human brains vary from computers. A computer working mode based on connectionism is proposed to replace the computer working mode based on the symbolic operation.

- Representative of connectionism: neural networks and deep learning


- Intelligence depends on perception and action. The perception-action model of intelligent behavior is proposed.

- Intelligence requires no knowledge, representation, or interface. AI can evolve like human intelligence. Intelligent behavior can only be demonstrated in the real world through constant interaction with the surrounding environment.

- Representative of behaviorism: behavior control, adaptation, and evolutionary computing.



**Types of AI**

 **Strong AI** - The strong AI view holds that it is possible to create intelligent machines that can reason and solve problems. Such machines are considered to be conscious and self-aware, can independently think about problems and work out optimal solutions to the problems, have their system of values and world views, and have all the same instincts as living things, such as survival and security needs. It can be regarded the same as a new civilization in a certain sense.

**Weak AI** - The weak AI view holds that intelligent machines cannot reason and solve problems. These machines only look intelligent but do not have real intelligence or self-awareness.
 

 # **Classifications of Intelligent robots**
Currently,there is no unified defenition of AI research. intelligent robots are generally classified into the following four types:

- Thinking like human beings: Weak AI, such as Watson and AlphaGo

- Acting like human beings: Weak AI, such as humanoid robot, iRobot, and Atlas of Boston Dynamics  

- Thinking rationally: Strong AI (Currently no intelligent robots of this type have beem created due to the bottleneck in brain science).

- Acting rationally: Strong AI
