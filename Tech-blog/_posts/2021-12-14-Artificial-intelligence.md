## Power of Ai
Humans naturally learn from experience – that is, by trial and error.  And humans can apply what they learn to different contexts.  Neither trait comes naturally to AI systems – they can only learn and apply what they’ve been programmed to learn – and the programming is difficult. Humans can learn in multiple areas and automatically apply what they learn.

Humans are often involved in complex situations.  In business, executives face complicated legislation, rapidly changing markets and competition, and many more complexities, yet must make decisions, sometimes quickly, that affect their company’s future.  People can make mistakes and learn from them.  However, computers can handle only those complex situations that they’re programmed to handle.

Humans continually make decisions under uncertainty – that is, with partial or even inaccurate, information. AI systems can handle such situations in many contexts.

Everyday humans receive masses of incoming information.  People can screen the information and discard irrelevant information – a skill built through experience.  Computers are limited by their programming – and it’s not easy to program a computer to know what’s irrelevant.
