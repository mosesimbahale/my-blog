# Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter and are for classification and regression. Generally, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to a decision. The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves. The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes while the decision nodes are where the data is split.  Basically, a decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where  


- Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute.  
- Each branch represents an outcome of the test. 
- Each leaf node holds a class label.  
- The topmost node in a tree is the root node.  

**Example** 

 Consider the following training dataset:
