### introduction: 

The programming requirements of data science demands a very versatile yet flexible language which is simple to write the code but can handle 
highly complex mathematical processing. Python is most suited for such requirements as it has already established itself both as a language for general 
computing as well as scientific computing. Moreover it is being continuously upgraded in form of new addition to its plethora of libraries aimed at different programming requirements.

### Features of python which makes it the preferred language for data science:

- A simple and easy to learn language which achieves result in fewer lines of code than other similar languages like R.
- It is cross platform, so the same code works in multiple environments without needing any change.
- It executes faster than other similar languages used for data analysis like R and MATLAB. 
- Its excellent memory management capability, especially garbage collection makes it versatile in gracefully managing very large volume of data transformation, slicing, dicing and visualization. 
- Python has got a very large collection of libraries which serve as special purpose analysis tools. E.g. NumPy package deals with scientific computing and its array needs much less memory than the conventional python list for managing numeric data. Also the number of such packages is continuously growing. 
- Python has packages which can directly use the code from other languages like Java or C. This helps in optimizing the code performance by using existing code of other languages, whenever it gives a better result. 


### Python Machine Learning Ecosystem 

The Python machine learning ecosystem is a collection of libraries that enable the developers to extract and transform data, perform data wrangling operations, apply existing robust Machine Learning algorithms and also develop custom algorithms easily. These libraries include numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, tensorflow, keras, etc. The following is a description of these libraries: 

1. PANDAS:- used for Data Analysis 
2. NUMPY: - used for numerical analysis and formation i.e. for matrix and vector manipulation 
3. MATPLOTLIB: - used for data visualization  
4. SCIPY: - used for scientific computing 
5. SEABORN: - used for data visualization 
6. TENSORFLOW: - used  in deep learning 
7. SCIKIT-LEARN: - used in machine learning i.e. used as a source for many machine learning algorithms and utilities 
8. KERAS : - used for neural networks and deep learning
