# Machine Learning


 
# Machine learning Defenition:
Machine learnig is a core research field of AI, and it is also necessary knowledge for deep learning. Therefore, this chapter mainly introduces the main concept of machine learning,and the common algorithms of machne learning


**Machine learning Algorithms(!)**

- Machine learning (including deep learning) is a study of the learning algorithms.A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T measured by P, improves with experience E.


# **DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND TRADITIONAL RULE-BASED ALGORITHMS**

- In rule based algorithms explicit programming is used to solve prooblems while in machine learning samples are used for training.

- Rules can be manually specified in rule based programming while in machile learning the decision making rules are complex or difficult to describe.

- In machine lerning rules are automatically learned by machines.

# Application scenarios of machine learning
1. The solution to a problem is complex, or the problem may involve a large amount of data without a clear data distribution function.

2. Machine learning can be used in the following scenarios:
- Rules are complex or cannot be described, such as voice recognition.

- Task rules change over time for example, in the part of speech tgging tasks, new words or meanings are generated at any time.

- Data distributio changes over time, requiring constant readaptation of programs such as predicting the trend of commodity sales.

# **RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS**

- Target function f is unknown. Learning algorithms cannot obtain a perfect function f.
- Assume that hypothesis function g approximates function f, but may be different from function f.


**Main problems solved by machine learning**

#### Machine learning can deal with many types of tasks. The following describes the most typical and common types of tasks:

- Classification: A computer program needs to specify which of the k categories some input belongs to. To acomplish this task, lerning algorithm usually output a function() for example, the image classification algorithm computer vision is designed to handle classification tasks.

- Regression: for this type of task, a computer program predicts the output for the given input larning algorithm, typically output a function () An example of this task type is to predict the claim amount of an insured person (to set the insuarence premium) or predict the security price.

- Clustering
