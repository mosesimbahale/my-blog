Relationship between AI, Machine learning, and Deep learning

- AI: A new technical science that focuses on the research and development of theories, methods, techniques, and applications systems for simulating and extending human intelligence.

- Machine learning: A core research field of AI. It focuses on how computers can obtain new knowledge or skills by simulating or performing the learning behavior of human beings and recognizing existing knowledge architecture to improve its performance. It is one of the core research fields of AI.

- Deep learning: A new field of machine learning. The concept of deep learning originates from the research on artificial neural networks. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of deep learning architecture. Deep learning aims to simulate the human brain to interpret data such as images, sounds, and texts.

Three major schools of thought: Symbolism.

a) Basic Thoughts
- The cognitive process of human beings is the process of inference and operation of various symbols.

- A human is a physical symbol system, and so is a computer. Computers, therefore, can be used to simulate the intelligent behavior of human beings.

- The core of AI relies in knowledge representation, knowledge inference, and knowledge application. Knowledge and concepts can be represented with symbols. Cognition is the process of symbol processing while inference refers to the process of solving problems by using heuristic knowledge and search.

- Representative of symbolism: inference, including symbolic inference and machine interface.


#### Representative of symbolism: inference, including symbolic inference and machine inference.

- The basis of thinking is neurons rather than the process of symbol processing.

- Human brains vary from computers. A computer working mode based on connectionism is proposed to replace the computer working mode based on the symbolic operation.

- Representative of connectionism: neural networks and deep learning


- Intelligence depends on perception and action. The perception-action model of intelligent behavior is proposed.

- Intelligence requires no knowledge, representation, or interface. AI can evolve like human intelligence. Intelligent behavior can only be demonstrated in the real world through constant interaction with the surrounding environment.

- Representative of behaviorism: behavior control, adaptation, and evolutionary computing.



**Types of AI**

 **Strong AI** - The strong AI view holds that it is possible to create intelligent machines that can reason and solve problems. Such machines are considered to be conscious and self-aware, can independently think about problems and work out optimal solutions to the problems, have their system of values and world views, and have all the same instincts as living things, such as survival and security needs. It can be regarded the same as a new civilization in a certain sense.

**Weak AI** - The weak AI view holds that intelligent machines cannot reason and solve problems. These machines only look intelligent but do not have real intelligence or self-awareness.
 

 # **Classifications of Intelligent robots**
Currently,there is no unified defenition of AI research. intelligent robots are generally classified into the following four types:

- Thinking like human beings: Weak AI, such as Watson and AlphaGo

- Acting like human beings: Weak AI, such as humanoid robot, iRobot, and Atlas of Boston Dynamics  

- Thinking rationally: Strong AI (Currently no intelligent robots of this type have beem created due to the bottleneck in brain science).

- Acting rationally: Strong AI
 
# Machine learning Defenition:
Machine learnig is a core research field of AI, and it is also necessary knowledge for deep learning. Therefore, this chapter mainly introduces the main concept of machine learning,and the common algorithms of machne learning


**Machine learning Algorithms(!)**

- Machine learning (including deep learning) is a study of the learning algorithms.A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T measured by P, improves with experience E.


# **DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND TRADITIONAL RULE-BASED ALGORITHMS**

- In rule based algorithms explicit programming is used to solve prooblems while in machine learning samples are used for training.

- Rules can be manually specified in rule based programming while in machile learning the decision making rules are complex or difficult to describe.

- In machine lerning rules are automatically learned by machines.

# Application scenarios of machine learning
1. The solution to a problem is complex, or the problem may involve a large amount of data without a clear data distribution function.

2. Machine learning can be used in the following scenarios:
- Rules are complex or cannot be described, such as voice recognition.

- Task rules change over time for example, in the part of speech tgging tasks, new words or meanings are generated at any time.

- Data distributio changes over time, requiring constant readaptation of programs such as predicting the trend of commodity sales.

# **RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS**

- Target function f is unknown. Learning algorithms cannot obtain a perfect function f.
- Assume that hypothesis function g approximates function f, but may be different from function f.


**Main problems solved by machine learning**

#### Machine learning can deal with many types of tasks. The following describes the most typical and common types of tasks:

- Classification: A computer program needs to specify which of the k categories some input belongs to. To acomplish this task, lerning algorithm usually output a function() for example, the image classification algorithm computer vision is designed to handle classification tasks.

- Regression: for this type of task, a computer program predicts the output for the given input larning algorithm, typically output a function () An example of this task type is to predict the claim amount of an insured person (to set the insuarence premium) or predict the security price.

- Clustering
