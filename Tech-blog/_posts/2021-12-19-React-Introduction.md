Hello and welcome!

## What's in our React App

Let's take a look of what our React App looks like right now. We will go through our file structure which is a [standard React setup.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) You will not be editing any files in this step, but the structure is important for future code references.

`package.json`

The `package.json` file is our roadmap of the app. It tells us the name of the app, the version, the different dependencies we need to run our app, and more.

`public/`

The `public/` directory contains our `index.html` file. The index.html file directs us to the rest of the web application that requires additional processing.

`src`

This is where most of your code will go. You'll notice we have `App.jsx` along with other `jsx` files. But, what is `jsx`? Think of `jsx` as a mix between html and javascript. We can write tags, functions, and classes. Take a look at the App.jsx file. Some of that contents might look familiar from html, like `<div/>` tags.

# **Step o1: Setup react application Locally.**
In this repository, we have two branches - `main` and `changes`. We will be working off of the changes branch. Let's go ahead and get started.
