# Python
Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum at Stitching Mathematisch Centrum in the Netherlands, it was a written as a successor of 'ABC'. Its first version was released in 1991. The name python was picked by Guido Van Rossum from a TV show named Monty Pythons's Flying circus.

It's an open source programming language which means that we can freely download it and use it to develop programs. Python programming language has the features of both C and Java. It has elegant 'C' code and on the other hand, it has classes and objects like Java for Object Oriented programming. It is an interpreted, which means the source code of python would first be converted into bytecode and then executed by python virtual machine.


**Why use python in Machine Learning?**

- **Python has an extensive and powerful set of packages** which are ready to be used in various domains. It also has packages like `numpy` `scipy` `pandas` `scikit-learn` etc. Which are required for machine learning and data science.

- **Ease of prototyping:** Another important feature of python that makes it the choice of language for data science . This feature is useful for developing new algorithms.

- **Collaboration :** The field of data science basically needs good collaboration and python provides many tools that makes this extremely easy.

- **One language for many domains:** Atypical data scieence project includes various domains like `data extraxtion`, `data manipulation`, `data analysis`, `feature extraction`, `data manipulation`, `modelling`, `evaluation`, `deployment`& `updating the solution`. As python is a multi-purpose language, it allows the data scientist to address all these domains from a common platform.


## **Components of python for ML Ecosystem**

These are some of the core Data Science libraries that form the components of python Machine learning ecosystem.

1. **Jupyter Notebook:** Basically provides an interactive computational environment for developing python based data science applications. They are formerly known as ipython notebooks.   

The following are some of the main features of Jupyter notebook that makes it one of the best components of python ML ecosystem.

- Jupyter notebook can illustrate teh analysis process step by step by arranginng the stuff like code, images, text, output etc. in a step by step manner.
- It helps a data scientist to document the though process while developing teh analysis process.
- One can also capture the results as part of the notebook.
- With the help of jupyternotebooks, we can share our work with a peer also.

2. **NumPy:** A useful component that makes python as one of the favorite languages for data science. It basically stands for Numerical Python and consists of multidimensional array objects. By using NumPy, we can perform the following important operations:

- Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
