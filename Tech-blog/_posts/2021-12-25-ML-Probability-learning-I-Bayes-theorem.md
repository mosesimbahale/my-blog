#### Introduction
**Bayes' theorem / theorem of conditional probability** - is one of the most famous and utilized theorems of probability theory.

It was developed by Thomas Bayes(1701 - 1761) was an english theologian and mathematician that belonged to the Royal society

- Imagine you have been diagnosed with  a very rare disease, which only affects 
`0.1% of the population`; that is 1 in every 1000 persons.

Therefore, Bayes' theorem, can be described using the following formulation:
