#### Artificial Intelligence(AI)
A broad term that refers to human intelligence exhibited by machines. It is the science of making things smart.

#### Narrow AI
A type of artificial intelligence that can perform one(or few) defined tasks well or betterthan a human experst. Common uxecases could be classifying text in user contact forms and automatically routing those messages to the respectve sub-teams in a company, or accurately detecting tumors in medical images.


#### Machine learning(ML)
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Itistheimplementation of theactual program that learns from prior experience to find patterns in a dataset. This paradigm contrasts traditional programming, where you hand-code rules to process data and arrive at answers.

#### Consider the usecase where you want to automatespam detection:
 A traditional programming approach would be to formulate explicit rules for the program. In contrast, A machine learning program would learn by looking at millions of comments that have already been labeled as spam or not spam. The system would then attempt to categorize new(and previously unseen) comments ass spam or not spam based on what it has learned by finding waht words are statistically significant.



#### Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning Programs
Additionally, you can reuse the model by feeding different training datato address a new use case! It is the reusability that makes machine learning so powerful since you do not need to change the code each time you change the application.



#### Advantages of using machine learning
In contrast to traditional programming, where programmers think logically and mathematically, machine learning involves training systems that make observations about complex data. The systems use statistics to update their understanding of the hidden patterns in the data. This shift in thinking provides machine learning several advantages.

- **Decrease in programming time** : Consider the problem of image recognition. while a traditional programmer might spend weeks coding the different explicit rules needed to recognize an image, they might end up with an algorithm that works onlyin certain situations while failing in others. You can solve the same problem in a fraction of the time required by using machine learning, where many sample images of the object are fed to a model to get reliable answers.


- **Customization** : You can customize machine learning models for diverse groups of users. Amachine learning model that recognizes one type of object can easily be retrained with sample images of another kind, allowing the programmer to develop solutions at super speed!

- **Complex problems** : Consider solving problems that require face recognition or text toxicity detection. these are complex problems to codesince they require defining hundreds or thousands of rules, yetthese problems arerelatively simple for machine learning model to figure out.



#### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that involves Deep Neural Networks (DNN) code structures arranged in layers that mimic low scietists believe the human brain works learning patterns of patterns as you go further down the layers.

For instance, a deep neural network may learn to recognize the content of images as shown in figure below














**Layer 1** The firstlayer may detect only lines and edges.

**Layer 2** The second layer may combine the data from the forst layer to detect shapes at a deeper level

**Layer 3**
 The third layer might combine shapes to detect objects by understandingtheir relative positiont to eachother

#### Relationship between AI, ML & DL

 Artificial intelligence, the process of enabling human intelligence in system, has a subset called machine learning which is the actual implementation of a program that can learn from data. Deep learning is a class of algorithms tha can drive a machine learning program.

#### Application of Machine learning:
1. Computer vision 
- Object Detection: identifying the location of objects in an image.
- Image recognition : Detect what exists in an image.
