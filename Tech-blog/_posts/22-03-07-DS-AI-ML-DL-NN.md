#### Artificial Intelligence(AI)
A broad term that refers to human intelligence exhibited by machines. It is the science of making things smart.

#### Narrow AI
A type of artificial intelligence that can perform one(or few) defined tasks well or betterthan a human experst. Common uxecases could be classifying text in user contact forms and automatically routing those messages to the respectve sub-teams in a company, or accurately detecting tumors in medical images.


#### Machine learning(ML)
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Itistheimplementation of theactual program that learns from prior experience to find patterns in a dataset. This paradigm contrasts traditional programming, where you hand-code rules to process data and arrive at answers.

#### Consider the usecase where you want to automatespam detection:
 A traditional programming approach would be to formulate explicit rules for the program. In contrast, A machine learning program would learn by looking at millions of comments that have already been labeled as spam or not spam. The system would then attempt to categorize new(and previously unseen) comments ass spam or not spam based on what it has learned by finding waht words are statistically significant.



#### Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning Programs
Additionally, you can reuse the model by feeding different training datato address a new use case! It is the reusability that makes machine learning so powerful since you do not need to change the code each time you change the application.



#### Advantages of using machine learning
In contrast to traditional programming, where programmers think logically and mathematically, machine learning involves training systems that make observations about complex data. The systems use statistics to update their understanding of the hidden patterns in the data. This shift in thinking provides machine learning several advantages.

- **Decrease in programming time** : Consider the problem of image recognition. while a traditional programmer might spend weeks coding the different explicit rules needed to recognize an image, they might end up with an algorithm that works onlyin certain situations while failing in others. You can solve the same problem in a fraction of the time required by using machine learning, where many sample images of the object are fed to a model to get reliable answers.
