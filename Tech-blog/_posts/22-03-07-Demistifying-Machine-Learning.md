**Supervised Learning**

Machine learning models aretrained in supervised learning using labeled examples or data. The model is provided with the ground truthfor each examples from which it will learn. In other words, each example consists of the dta and the label that tells the model what the correct output for the data is.
Supervised learning aims to learn from the examples and generalizes its learning to data it hasn't seen before. A model performs well only when you provide **deverse and well-labeled data** for training.


Letâ€™s understand how you can use Supervised Learning to train a model to categorize fruits into apples or oranges.
